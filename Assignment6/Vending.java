        1. Find the Fewest Notes to be returned for Vending Machine

            returned by Vending Machine. Write a Program to calculate the minimum number
            of Notes as well as the Notes to be returned by the Vending Machine as a
            Change
            b. I/P -> read the Change in Rs to be returned by the Vending Machine
            c. Logic -> Use Recursion and check for largest value of the Note to return change
            to get to the minimum number of Notes.
            d. O/P -> Two Outputs - one the number of minimum Note needed to give the
            change and second list of Rs Notes that would given in the Change
